- Phone (integer phone validation)
- Address (string)
- City (string)
- Province (string)
- House value (integer)

- Amount requested (integer)


npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name LoanInquiry --attributes name:string,email:string,phone:integer,address:string,city:string,province:string,house_value:integer,owing_against:integer,amount_requested:integer

//go ahead continue

//complete this command and paste it on the command line

//ok

//anything else for now?
//thatsall  ok i watch you ok 


Must use sequelize CLI

- Cannot use sequelize sync, everything must be done in migration files only

Have a logged in user (whatever method you want for now)

User can view list of inquiries

- User can make offer on inquiry
- offer includes
    - interest rate (integer)
    - comments (text)

Put this in a many to many relationship with junction table

- Inquiry can have many user
- User can have many inquiry

Display offers from users on the inquiry page
